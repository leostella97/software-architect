The software architect is responsible for making high-level decisions related to code organization, choice of technologies, systems design, and component integration. They need to understand customer requirements and translate them into a viable technical architecture.

Additionally, software architects often collaborate with other team members such as programmers and designers to ensure the successful implementation of the defined architecture. They also need to be aware of industry trends and best practices to ensure their solutions are modern and effective.

The role of the software architect is crucial for developing robust and efficient software systems, integrating technical skills, strategic vision and in-depth understanding of project requirements.
